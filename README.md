## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AREEB-CHALLENGE.git
cd AREEB-CHALLENGE
```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server

```bash
# Install client dependencies
cd client
pnpm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables

```bash
# In the server directory, create a .env file
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

```
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. Run database migrations

```bash
cd server
pnpm migrate
```

5. (Optional) Seed the database with test data

```bash
pnpm seed
```

### Running the Application

#### Development mode

```bash
# Start the server (from server directory)
pnpm start:dev

# Start the client (from client directory)
pnpm dev
```

#### Production mode

```bash
# Build the client
cd client
pnpm build

# Start the server in production mode
cd ../server
pnpm start:prod
```

## Client (Frontend)

### Architecture

The frontend is built with Vue.js 3 using the Composition API and TypeScript. It uses Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement during development.

### Key Components

- **Auth Components** - Handle user authentication and registration
- **Event Components** - Display and interact with event data
- **Admin Components** - Provide admin-only functionality
- **UI Components** - Reusable UI elements built with Tailwind CSS

### State Management

State management is handled using Pinia stores:

- **Auth Store** - Manages authentication state and user sessions
- **User Store** - Manages user data and preferences

## Server (Backend)

### API Structure

The backend follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Routes** - Define API endpoints
- **Controllers** - Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services** - Contain business logic
- **Models** - Define data structures and database interactions

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin vs. Regular users)
- Protected routes with custom middleware

### Database

- SQLite database using Better-SQLite3
- Database migrations for schema management
- Seeders for populating test data

### Middleware

- Error handling middleware
- Authentication middleware
- Validation middleware using Express Validator
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Testing

The server includes a comprehensive test suite using Vitest. Tests cover:

- Authentication flows
- Event management
- Booking processes
- User management
- Admin operations

To run tests:

```bash
cd server
pnpm test
```

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Run database migrations before starting the server
- Consider using a process manager like PM2 for production

### Frontend Deployment

- Build the Vue.js application
- Serve static files through a web server like Nginx
- Consider CDN for assets
